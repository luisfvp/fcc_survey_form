# Survey Form Project - HTML and CSS Certification Challenge

### Description:

Welcome to the Survey Form Project, a crucial step on my journey to earning my FreeCodeCamp certification in HTML and CSS technologies! This hands-on project is designed to reinforce my understanding of HTML and CSS while providing me with a practical application of my newfound skills.

In this project, I will have the opportunity to create a fully functional survey form using HTML and CSS. This form will not only showcase my ability to structure content with HTML but also demonstrate my styling prowess with CSS. The project aims to test my understanding of form elements, input fields, labels, and styling techniques, offering a comprehensive exercise that aligns with industry standards.
